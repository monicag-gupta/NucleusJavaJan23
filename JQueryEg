There are two ways to use jQuery.
Local Installation − You can download jQuery library on your local machine and include it in your HTML code.
Go to the https://releases.jquery.com/ to download the latest version available.
Now put downloaded jquery-3.6.1.min.js file in a directory of your website, e.g. /jquery.
<script type = "text/javascript" src = "/jquery/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script>
CDN Based Version − You can include jQuery library into your HTML code directly from Content Delivery Network (CDN).
