To create a repository using TortoiseSVN, follow the below steps:
Step1: Open the windows explorer and create a new folder and name it e.g., SVN_Prj1.
Make the folder Read-Write (un-tick read-only in properties of folder)
Step2: Right-click on the newly created folder and select option TortoiseSVN â†’ Create Repository here.
An SVN repository will be created. 
Next, it will ask you for the default folder structure. 
Select the Create Folder structure option.
A new repository is created inside SVN_Prj1. 
Don't edit the default repository files. 
If it shows any errors, make sure that the folder is empty and not write-protected.
TortoiseSVN will set a default folder icon when it creates a repository to identify local repositories. 
If we create a repository by any other option, this folder icon is not assigned.
