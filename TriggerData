      A database trigger is a stored PL/SQL program unit associated with a specific database table. ORACLE executes (fires) a database trigger automatically when a given SQL operation (like INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) affects the table. Unlike a procedure, or a function, which must be invoked explicitly, database triggers are invoked implicitly. 



Database triggers can be used to perform any of the following: 
Audit data modification 
Log events transparently 
Enforce complex business rules 
Derive column values automatically 
Implement complex security authorizations 
Maintain replicate tables 




You can associate up to 12 database triggers with a given table. A database trigger has three parts: a triggering event, an optional trigger constraint, and a trigger action. 

When an event occurs, a database trigger is fired, and an predefined PL/SQL block will perform the necessary action. 



The trigger_name references the name of the trigger. 
BEFORE or AFTER specify when the trigger is fired (before or after the triggering event). 
The triggering_event references a DML statement issued against the table (e.g., INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE). 
The table_name is the name of the table associated with the trigger. 
The clause, FOR EACH ROW, specifies a trigger is a row trigger and fires once for each modified row. 
A WHEN clause specifies the condition for a trigger to be fired. 
Bear in mind that if you drop a table, all the associated triggers for the table are dropped as well. 




When you define a trigger, you can specify the number of times the trigger action is to be run:
Once for every row affected by the triggering statement, such as a trigger fired by an UPDATE statement that updates many rows
Once for the triggering statement, no matter how many rows it affects





Row level trigger:

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER restrict_salary
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
IF :NEW.salary > 15000 THEN
RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR (-20202,'Employee cannot earn more than $15,000.');
END IF;
END;
/



INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, last_name, first_name, email, hire_date, job_id, salary, department_id)
VALUES (305, 'Smith', 'Rob', 'RSMITH05', SYSDATE, 'AD_PRES', 19500, 60);
