To execute a statement against a database, the following flow is observed
Load the driver (Only performed once)
Obtain a Connection to the database (Save for later use)
Obtain a Statement object from the Connection
Use the Statement object to execute SQL.  Updates, inserts and deletes return Boolean.  Selects return a ResultSet
Navigate ResultSet, using data as required
Close ResultSet
Close Statement

Do NOT close the connection after every statement
The same connection object can be used to create further statements
A Connection may only have one active Statement at a time.  Do not forget to close the statement when it is no longer needed.
Close the connection when you no longer need to access the database
