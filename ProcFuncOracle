CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE greetings
 AS
 BEGIN 
dbms_output.put_line('Hello World!');
 END;
 /



A standalone procedure can be called in two ways:
Using the EXECUTE keyword
Calling the name of the procedure from a PL/SQL block
The above procedure named 'greetings' can be called with the EXECUTE keyword as:

EXECUTE greetings;


The above call would display:
Hello World PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.


The procedure can also be called from another PL/SQL block:


BEGIN 
greetings; 
END; 
/
