PL/SQL, you can create your own Procedures.
When you create a Procedure or function, you have to define this three parameters.
1.) IN - IN parameter is referenced to the procedure or function. And value of paramameter in not overwritten.
2.) OUT - OUT parameter is referenced to the procedure or function. And value of paramameter is overwritten allow.
3.) IN OUT - IN OUT parameter is referenced to the procedure or function. And value of paramameter is both overwritten allow or not allow.




CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE greetings
 AS
 BEGIN 
dbms_output.put_line('Hello World!');
 END;
 /



A standalone procedure can be called in two ways:
Using the EXECUTE keyword
Calling the name of the procedure from a PL/SQL block
The above procedure named 'greetings' can be called with the EXECUTE keyword as:

EXECUTE greetings;


The above call would display:
Hello World PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.


The procedure can also be called from another PL/SQL block:


BEGIN 
greetings; 
END; 
/





Deleting a Standalone Procedure
A standalone procedure is deleted with the DROP PROCEDURE statement. Syntax for deleting a procedure is:
DROP PROCEDURE procedure-name; 
So you can drop greetings procedure by using the following statement:


DROP PROCEDURE greetings; 



DECLARE
 a number;
b number; 
c number; 
PROCEDURE findMin(x IN number, y IN number, z OUT number) 
IS 
BEGIN 
IF x < y THEN z:= x; ELSE z:= y; 
END IF; 
END;
BEGIN
 a:= 23; 
b:= 45; 
findMin(a, b, c); 
dbms_output.put_line(' Minimum of (23, 45) : ' || c); 
END;
 /




CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE findMin11(x IN number, y IN number, z OUT number) 
AS 
BEGIN 
IF x < y THEN z:= x; ELSE z:= y; 
END IF; 
END;


DECLARE
 a number;
b number; 
c number; 
BEGIN
 a:= 23; 
b:= 45; 
findMin11(a, b, c); 
dbms_output.put_line(' Minimum of (23, 45) : ' || c); 
END;
 /
